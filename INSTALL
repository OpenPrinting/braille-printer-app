INSTALL - OpenPrinting Braille Printer Application v1.0b1 - 2022-11-18
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install OpenPrinting
braille-printer-app from source code. For more information on
OpenPrinting braille-printer-app see the file called "README.md". A
complete change log can be found in "CHANGES.md".


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

    You'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers, plus a make program and
    POSIX-compliant shell (/bin/sh).  The GNU compiler tools and Bash work well
    and we have tested the current CUPS code against several versions of GCC
    with excellent results.

    The Makefiles used by the project should work with most versions of make.
    We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs shipped by
    Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.  BSD users should use GNU make (gmake) since BSD
    make does not support "include".

    CUPS (2.2.2 or newer), libcupsfilters 2.x, and libppd must be
    installed to be able to compile this package.

COMPILING THE GIT REPOSITORY CODE

    The braille-printer-app GIT repository doesn't hold a copy of the pre-built
    configure script.  You'll need to run the GNU autoconf software (2.65 or
    higher) to create it:

        ./autogen.sh


CONFIGURATION

    braille-printer-app uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the
    usual "configure" script in the main braille-printer-app source
    directory. To configure braille-printer-app for your system,
    type:

	./configure

    The default installation will put the braille-printer-app software in the
    "/usr" directory on your system.

    Use the "--prefix" option to install the braille-printer-app
    software in another location:

	./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    To see a complete list of configuration options, use the --help option:

        ./configure --help

    If any of the dependent libraries are not installed in a system default
    location (typically "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib") you'll need to set the
    CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, DSOFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment variables
    prior to running configure:

	setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	./configure ...

    or:

	CFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	./configure ...

    Once you have configured things, just type:

	make ENTER

    or if you have FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD type:

	gmake ENTER

    to build the software.

INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

    Once you have built the software you need to install it.  The "install"
    target provides a quick way to install the software on your local system:

	make install ENTER

    or for FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD:

	gmake install ENTER

PACKAGING THE SOFTWARE FOR OPERATING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTIONS

    This Braille embosser support package is important for
    accessibility, for written, paper-based communication with blind
    people. So it is highly recommended for desktop distributions and
    generally distributions with a CUPS printing stack.

    In addition to the package itself cups-filters 2.x, liblouis,
    ImageMagick, and poppler-utils need to be installed. Recommended
    is to also have liblouisutdml, antiword, docx2txt for more
    sophisticated Braille generation representing also the formatting
    of the input text. None of these is needed for compiling
    braille-printer-app.
