I was debugging.
I tried 
case1:
data->vendor[data->num_vendor++] = "TopMargin";
ippAddInteger(*attrs, IPP_TAG_PRINTER, IPP_TAG_INTEGER,"TopMargin", 3);
and 
case2:
data->vendor[data->num_vendor++] = "TopMargin";
ippAddInteger(*attrs, IPP_TAG_PRINTER, IPP_TAG_INTEGER,"TopMargin-default", 3);


when I checked the logs, it was not showing the value anywhere which is getting set to 3. Its always showing TopMargin default value as 2.

But if I will pass -o TopMargin=3 or TopMargin-default=3 then it is able to take Selected TopMargin value 3
