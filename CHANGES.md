# CHANGES - OpenPrinting Braille Printer Application v1.0b1 - 2024-11-10

## CHANGES IN V1.0b1 (TBA)

- configure.ac: Added "foreign" to to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE() call. Makes
  automake not require a file named README.

- textbrftoindex: Fix control character filtering (Pull request #409)

- Build system: Remove `-D_PPD_DEPRECATED=""` from the compiling
  command lines of the source files which use libcups. The flag is not
  supported any more for longer times already and all the PPD-related
  functions deprecated by CUPS have moved into libppd now.

- Build system: Add files in `.gitignore` that are generated by
  `autogen.sh`, `configure`, and `make` (Pull request #336).
